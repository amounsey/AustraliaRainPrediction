Context
Predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow by training a binary classification model on target RainTomorrow

Content
This dataset contains daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.

The target variable RainTomorrow means: Did it rain the next day? Yes or No.

Note: You should exclude the variable Risk-MM when training a binary classification model. Not excluding it will leak the answers to your model and reduce its predictability. Read more about it here.
